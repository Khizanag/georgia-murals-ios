			bio: "The artists APHE (Oliver Hollatz, 29 years old) and NOAH (Noah Kauertz, 26 years old) got to know each other during their art studies in Bonn. Their common interest in art in public spaces and their passion for painting led to the first collaboration in the form of a facade design in 2019. In the same year, four more murals were created, which significantly shaped the collaboration between the artists in terms of color, style and subject. Her dialogic painting moves fluidly between representation and abstraction and is strongly influenced by an atmospheric color aesthetic.",
